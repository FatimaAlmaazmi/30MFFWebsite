 ## Let's Zoom!
 
 This is the premiere website for Suman and I's short film. The concept of the website is based on Zoom features like the Zoom tiles. The theme is simple, cute and playful to bounce off of the film's friendship theme. I tried to create a fun and simple experience for the users.
 
### Process

First I worked off of the wireframe I created in the beginineg of the semester. I wanted to create a website with a simple format. Where users would click on the tabs at the top of the page, and that would take them to the allocated sections. If they wish to return, they would click on the button on the bottom right to scroll back to the top of the website. 


For the theme, I wanted to add Zoom tiles as a background. However, finding one online was a challange. So, I opted to making one on my own, and that pushed me to make the rest of the images used in this website, like the sponsor's logos and the cast photos.


### Reflection

Making this website was harder than I anticipated. Although my layout seemed simple, putting everything together was really tiring. I have never spent this much time on my laptop, and its a bit concerning. However, I enjoyed the experience, and I am content with what I have created. 


Thank you :)
